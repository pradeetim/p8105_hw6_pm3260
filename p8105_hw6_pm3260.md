``` r

    ## The rnoaa package will soon be retired and archived because the underlying APIs have changed dramatically. The package currently works but does not pull the most recent data in all cases. A noaaWeather package is planned as a replacement but the functions will not be interchangeable.

### Data cleaning/setup:

``` r
homicide = 
  read.csv("data/homicide-data.csv")|>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    state = str_to_upper(state),
    city_state = str_c(city, ", ", state),
    solved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ 1, 
      disposition %in% c("Closed without arrest", "Open/No arrest") ~ 0),
      victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age)
    ) |>
  filter(
    victim_race %in% c("White", "Black"),
    !city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")
    )
```

### Adjusted OR and 95% CI for Baltimore, MD:

``` r
homicide_balt =
  homicide |>
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") |>
  glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = _, 
      family = binomial()) |>
  broom::tidy() |>
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         conf.low = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
         conf.high = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error)
         ) |>
  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |>
  select(OR, conf.low, conf.high)
```

#### Interpretation:

Adjusted OR: 0.4255117

Adjusted 95% CI: (0.324559, 0.5578655)

Adjusting for age and race, the estimated odds of having a solved case
for those identifying as female is 0.43 times the odds of having a
solved case for those identifying as male. We are 95% confident that the
true OR lies between 0.325 and 0.558.

### Adjusted OR and 95% CI for all cities in dataset.

``` r
homicide_cities =
  homicide |>
  group_by(city_state) |>
  nest() |>
  mutate(
    glm_results = map(data, ~glm(solved ~ victim_age + victim_race + victim_sex, data = .x, family = binomial())),
    tidy_results = map(glm_results, ~broom::tidy(.x))) |>
  mutate(
    or_city = map(tidy_results, ~ .x |>
                  filter(term == "victim_sexMale") |>
                  mutate(
                    OR = exp(estimate),
                    conf.low = exp(estimate - 1.96 * std.error),
                    conf.high = exp(estimate + 1.96 * std.error))|>
                  select(OR, conf.low, conf.high))) |>
  unnest(or_city) |>
  select(city_state, OR, conf.low, conf.high)

#### Description:

Only 4 cities have ORs over 1, meaning there is a higher odds for
females in having a solved case than males. However, even these cities
have their CI encompass the null value of 1 and below, meaning that
there is a chance the estimated adjusted OR is the same as the true
adjusted odds.

New York has the smallest OR, meaning victims who identify as women have
the least odds of having a solved case here than the other cities in
this data set.
